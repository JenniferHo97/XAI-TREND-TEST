# Trend-based Faithfulness Test

This is the code for our paper which is submitted to ACM CCS'22.

We use `python3.7` to run this code with some necessary packages:

```text
captum==0.4.0
pytorch==1.9.0+cu111
torchtext==0.10.0
torchvision==0.10.0+cu111
gensim==4.1.2
numpy==1.20.3

```

This version is only used for paper review. In the future, we will open source our codes in the form of docker to make it easier for test.
